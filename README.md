# Task 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION: 

# Introduction: 
The Titanic Survival Prediction project is a classic and widely recognized machine learning task. It involves analyzing and predicting the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as their age, gender, ticket class, and more. This project is both an excellent starting point for beginners and a challenging problem for advanced practitioners due to the real-world complexity of the dataset.

# Background:
On April 15, 1912, the Titanic, a British passenger liner, sank after hitting an iceberg during its maiden voyage. Over 1,500 passengers and crew lost their lives, making it one of the deadliest maritime disasters in modern history. The tragedy has since been a subject of intense study and analysis.

# Taks Description:
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether a passenger on Titanic survived or not. This is a classic beginner project with readily available data.

The dataset typically used for this project contains nformation about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived.

# Overview:
Developed a predictive model to determine survival likelihood on the Titanic dataset.
Utilized several classification models to predict survival
Implemented the project using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn for analysis and model development.

# About The Dataset:
The Titanic Dataset is a dataset curated on the basis of the passengers on titanic, like their age, class, gender, etc to predict if they would have survived or not. It contains both numerical and string values. It has 12 predefined columns which are as below:

Passenger ID - To identify unique passengers
Survived - If they survived or not
PClass - The class passengers travelled in
Name - Passenger Name
Sex - Gender of Passenger
Age - Age of passenger
SibSp - Number of siblings or spouse
Parch - Parent or child
Ticket - Ticket number
Fare - Amount paid for the ticket
Cabin - Cabin of residence
Embarked - Point of embarkment
# Conclusion:
